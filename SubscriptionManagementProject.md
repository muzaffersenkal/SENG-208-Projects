# Subscription Management

## Project Overview:
The Subscription Management system is a Python-based application designed to help users manage their subscriptions effectively. It provides functionalities for adding, updating, deleting subscriptions, tracking payment details, setting reminders, and analyzing subscription expenses.

## Features:
1. **Authentication System:**
    - Only authorized users can access the system.
    - Username and password authentication.

2. **Subscription Management:**
    - Add new subscriptions to the system.
    - Update existing subscription details like name, amount, billing cycle, etc.
    - Delete subscriptions from the system.

3. **Payment Tracking:**
    - Record payment details for each subscription (e.g., payment date, amount).

4. **Reminder Setting:**
    - Set reminders for upcoming subscription payments.

5. **Search Functionality:**
    - Search for subscriptions by keywords, billing cycle, amount, or payment status.

6. **Display Subscriptions:**
    - Display all subscriptions.
    - Display subscriptions by payment status or upcoming payment dates.

7. **Expense Analysis:**
    - Calculate total expenses for subscriptions.
    - Analyze subscription expenses over time.

8. **Data:**
    - Store subscription data in a file.

## Technologies Used:
- Python programming language.
- Standard libraries like `os`, `csv`or `pandas`  for file handling and CSV file manipulation.- Basic data structures like lists, dictionaries for storing and managing data.
- Command-line interface for user interaction.

## Project Structure:
1. **Main Module (`main.py`):**
    - Contains the main logic of the application.
    - Handles user authentication and menu navigation.

2. **Subscription Module (`subscription.py`):**
    - Functions related to subscription management (add, update, delete, search).

3. **Payment Module (`payment.py`):**
    - Functions to record and manage payment details for subscriptions.

4. **Reminder Module (`reminder.py`):**
    - Functions to set reminders for upcoming subscription payments.

5. **Search Module (`search.py`):**
    - Functions to search for subscriptions by keywords, billing cycle, amount, or payment status.

6. **Display Module (`display.py`):**
    - Functions to display subscription information and payment details.

7. **Analysis Module (`analysis.py`):**
    - Functions to calculate total expenses and analyze subscription expenses over time.

8. **Data Module (`data.py`):**
    - Handles data persistence (read/write data to files/database).

9. **Utils Module (`utils.py`):**
    - Utility functions used across modules.

## User Interaction:
- Upon running the application, users are prompted to log in with their username and password.
- After successful authentication, users are presented with a menu of options to perform various tasks.
- Users can navigate through the menu by entering corresponding numbers/options.

## Additional Considerations:
- Error handling: Implement robust error handling to handle unexpected inputs and scenarios gracefully.
- Logging: Implement logging to record significant events and errors for debugging and auditing purposes.
- Documentation: Include inline comments and documentation to make the codebase understandable and maintainable.
- OOP: use object-oriented programming principles for code organization and modularity.
