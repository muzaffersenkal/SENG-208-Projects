# Library Management System

## Project Overview
The Library Management System (LMS) is a Python-based application designed to manage a library's operations efficiently. It allows librarians to perform various tasks such as adding, updating, and deleting books, managing member records, handling borrowing and returning books.

## Features
1. **Authentication System:**
    - Only authorized users (administrators/librarians) can access the system.
    - Username and password authentication.

2. **Book Management:**
    - Add new books to the library database.
    - Update existing book details like title, author, quantity, etc.
    - Delete books from the database.

3. **Member Management:**
    - Add new library members.
    - Update member details such as name, contact information, etc.
    - Remove members from the system.

4. **Borrowing and Returning Books:**
    - Allow members to borrow books.
    - Record borrowing history (member ID, book ID, date borrowed, due date).
    - Implement a system for book return.

5. **Search Functionality:**
    - Search for books by title, author, category, or ISBN.
    - Search for members by name, ID, or contact information.

6. **Data Persistence:**
    - Store library data in a file.

## Technologies Used
- Python programming language.
- Standard libraries like `os`, `datetime`, `csv` or `pandas` for file handling, date/time operations, and CSV file manipulation.
- Basic data structures like lists, dictionaries for storing and managing data.
- Command-line interface for user interaction.

## Project Structure
1. **Main Module (`main.py`):**
    - Contains the main logic of the application.
    - Handles user authentication and menu navigation.

2. **Book Module (`book.py`):**
    - Functions related to book management (add, update, delete, search).

3. **Member Module (`member.py`):**
    - Functions related to member management (add, update, delete, search).

4. **Borrow Module (`borrow.py`):**
    - Functions related to borrowing and returning books.

5. **Data Module (`data.py`):**
    - Handles data persistence (read/write data to files/database).

6. **Utils Module (`utils.py`):**
    - Utility functions used across modules.

## User Interaction
- Upon running the application, users are prompted to log in with their username and password.
- After successful authentication, users are presented with a menu of options to perform various tasks.
- Users can navigate through the menu by entering corresponding numbers/options.

## Additional Considerations
- Error handling: Implement robust error handling to handle unexpected inputs and scenarios gracefully.
- Logging: Implement logging to record significant events and errors for debugging and auditing purposes.
- Documentation: Include inline comments and documentation to make the codebase understandable and maintainable.
- OOP: use object-oriented programming principles for code organization and modularity.
