# Note Taking Project

## Project Overview:
The Note Taking Project (NTP) is a Python-based tool designed to help users take and manage notes efficiently. It provides functionalities for adding, updating, deleting notes, categorizing notes, searching, and displaying notes.

## Features:
1. **Authentication System:**
    - Only authorized users can access the system.
    - Username and password authentication.

2. **Note Management:**
    - Add new notes to the application.
    - Update existing note details like title, content, category, etc.
    - Delete notes from the application.

3. **Categorization:**
    - Categorize notes into different categories (e.g., work, personal, study).

4. **Search Functionality:**
    - Search for notes by keywords, category, title, or content.

5. **Display Notes:**
    - Display all notes.
    - Display notes by category.

6. **Data Persistence:**
    - Store note data in a file.

## Technologies Used:
- Python programming language.
- Standard libraries like `os`, `csv` or `pandas` for file handling and CSV file manipulation.
- Basic data structures like lists, dictionaries for storing and managing data.
- Command-line interface for user interaction.

## Project Structure:
1. **Main Module (`main.py`):**
    - Contains the main logic of the application.
    - Handles user authentication and menu navigation.

2. **Note Module (`note.py`):**
    - Functions related to note management (add, update, delete, search).

3. **Category Module (`category.py`):**
    - Functions related to note categorization.

4. **Search Module (`search.py`):**
    - Functions to search for notes by keywords, category, title, or content.

5. **Display Module (`display.py`):**
    - Functions to display notes.

6. **Data Module (`data.py`):**
    - Handles data persistence (read/write data to files)

7. **Utils Module (`utils.py`):**
    - Utility functions used across modules.

## User Interaction:
- Upon running the application, users are prompted to log in with their username and password.
- After successful authentication, users are presented with a menu of options to perform various tasks.
- Users can navigate through the menu by entering corresponding numbers/options.

## Additional Considerations:
- Error handling: Implement robust error handling to handle unexpected inputs and scenarios gracefully.
- Logging: Implement logging to record significant events and errors for debugging and auditing purposes.
- Documentation: Include inline comments and documentation to make the codebase understandable and maintainable.
- OOP: use object-oriented programming principles for code organization and modularity.
