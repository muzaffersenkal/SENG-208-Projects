# Contact Management System

## Project Overview:
The Contact Management System (CMS) is a Python-based application designed to help users manage their contacts efficiently. It provides functionalities for adding, updating, deleting contacts, categorizing contacts, searching, and displaying contacts.

## Features:
1. **Authentication System:**
    - Only authorized users can access the system.
    - Username and password authentication.

2. **Contact Management:**
    - Add new contacts to the system.
    - Update existing contact details like name, phone number, email, etc.
    - Delete contacts from the system.

3. **Categorization:**
    - Categorize contacts into different groups (e.g., friends, family, work).

4. **Search Functionality:**
    - Search for contacts by name, phone number, email, or category.

5. **Display Contacts:**
    - Display all contacts.
    - Display contacts by category.

6. **Data Persistence:**
    - Store contact data in a file/database to ensure persistence across sessions.

## Technologies Used:
- Python programming language.
- Standard libraries like `os`, `csv` for file handling and CSV file manipulation.
- Basic data structures like lists, dictionaries for storing and managing data.
- Command-line interface for user interaction.

## Project Structure:
1. **Main Module (`main.py`):**
    - Contains the main logic of the application.
    - Handles user authentication and menu navigation.

2. **Contact Module (`contact.py`):**
    - Functions related to contact management (add, update, delete, search).

3. **Category Module (`category.py`):**
    - Functions related to contact categorization.

4. **Search Module (`search.py`):**
    - Functions to search for contacts by name, phone number, email, or category.

5. **Display Module (`display.py`):**
    - Functions to display contacts.

6. **Data Module (`data.py`):**
    - Handles data persistence (read/write data to files).

7. **Utils Module (`utils.py`):**
    - Utility functions used across modules.

## User Interaction:
- Upon running the application, users are prompted to log in with their username and password.
- After successful authentication, users are presented with a menu of options to perform various tasks.
- Users can navigate through the menu by entering corresponding numbers/options.

## Additional Considerations:
- Error handling: Implement robust error handling to handle unexpected inputs and scenarios gracefully.
- Logging: Implement logging to record significant events and errors for debugging and auditing purposes.
- Documentation: Include inline comments and documentation to make the codebase understandable and maintainable.
- OOP: use object-oriented programming principles for code organization and modularity.

## Conclusion:
The Contact Management System provides a simple yet effective solution for users to organize and manage their contacts efficiently. With its user-friendly interface and essential features, it helps users keep track of their contacts, categorize them, and quickly find the information they need.
