# Expense Tracker

## Project Overview:
The  Expense Tracker (CLET) is a Python-based application designed to help users manage their expenses efficiently. It provides functionalities for recording expenses, categorizing expenses, setting budgets.

## Features:
1. **Authentication System:**
    - Only authorized users can access the system.
    - Username and password authentication.

2. **Expense Tracking:**
    - Add new expenses to the tracker.
    - Update existing expense details like description, amount, category, etc.
    - Delete expenses from the tracker.

3. **Expense Categorization:**
    - Categorize expenses into different categories (e.g., groceries, utilities, transportation).

4. **Budget Setting:**
    - Set monthly budgets for different expense categories.
    - Display budget status to track spending against the set budgets.

5. **Search Functionality:**
    - Search for expenses by keywords, category, amount, or date.

6. **Data Persistence:**
    - Store expense data in a file.

## Technologies Used:
- Python programming language.
- Standard libraries like `os`, `datetime`, `csv` for file handling, date/time operations, and CSV file manipulation.
- Basic data structures like lists, dictionaries for storing and managing data.
- Command-line interface for user interaction.

## Project Structure:
1. **Main Module (`main.py`):**
    - Contains the main logic of the application.
    - Handles user authentication and menu navigation.

2. **Expense Module (`expense.py`):**
    - Functions related to expense management (add, update, delete, search).

3. **Budget Module (`budget.py`):**
    - Functions related to budget setting and tracking.

4. **Search Module (`search.py`):**
    - Functions to search for expenses by keywords, category, amount, or date.

5. **Data Module (`data.py`):**
    - Handles data persistence (read/write data to files/database).

6. **Utils Module (`utils.py`):**
    - Utility functions used across modules.

## User Interaction:
- Upon running the application, users are prompted to log in with their username and password.
- After successful authentication, users are presented with a menu of options to perform various tasks.
- Users can navigate through the menu by entering corresponding numbers/options.

## Additional Considerations:
- Error handling: Implement robust error handling to handle unexpected inputs and scenarios gracefully.
- Logging: Implement logging to record significant events and errors for debugging and auditing purposes.
- Documentation: Include inline comments and documentation to make the codebase understandable and maintainable.
- OOP: use object-oriented programming principles for code organization and modularity.
